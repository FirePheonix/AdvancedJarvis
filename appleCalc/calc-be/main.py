    # FastAPI's lifespan is a feature that allows you to define setup and cleanup logic for your application. It is useful for managing resources like database connections, cache, or any initialization and teardown tasks.

    # Key Points:
    # Setup Logic: IT'S THE CODE THAT GETS EXECUTED BEFORE the app starts serving requests (e.g., connecting to a database).
    # Teardown Logic: Runs after the app stops (e.g., closing connections).
    # How to Use:
    # Define a generator function using @asynccontextmanager.
    # Use it with FastAPIâ€™s lifespan parameter.
    # Purpose: Ensures proper resource management throughout the app's lifecycle.
